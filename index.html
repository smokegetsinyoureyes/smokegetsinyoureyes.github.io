		It was a thin, spindly thing, decorated with bubbles suspended in ropes within shells of clear plastic and scalloped ribbons of gold lining. It hung from a fine, honey-colored chain that could loop thrice around her neck and still linger on the blank span of sternum between her breasts. It's curls were soft and looped were it swung from around her neck, the weight pleasant on the skin of her nape and collarbones, the wire-thick strands of gold links too small to pinch or tug at the fine hairs of her upper spine. They were as large as the crystal sands, the links, pearly where the light from her fathers broken lamp hit their warped curves, and they shone yellow, the color, her mother had said, of time. Yellow like golden strands of hair, like harsh sunlight on the off-white sands of the Mediterranean, like the inside of an orchid blossom, magnified by a bead of dew.
